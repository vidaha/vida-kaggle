# MAGIC Variable Notes
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
# MAGIC 1st = Upper
# MAGIC 2nd = Middle
# MAGIC 3rd = Lower
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# MAGIC Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
# MAGIC Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# MAGIC Parent = mother, father
# MAGIC Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
# MAGIC Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
